 * Old installs kept teamai's project-scope machine data (config, state, the
 * team-repo clone, search index, per-worktree managed-mcp + resource cache …)
 * inside the business repo at `<workspaceRoot>/.teamai/`. P1-2 flipped NEW
 * installs to the partition `~/.teamai/projects/<slug>/` and reads old installs
 * via a legacy fallback. This module moves a real legacy `.teamai/` INTO the
 * partition the first time a write command (`init`/`pull`/`push`) runs, so the
 * business workspace ends up with zero teamai residue.
 *
 * Safety model (issue R2): copy → verify → atomic rename, so an interruption
 * never leaves the data half-in-both-places. The source is only renamed to
 * `.teamai.bak/` AFTER the partition is fully in place; we never delete it.
 *
 * Trigger is narrowed by the caller (the global preAction hook): hook-dispatch
 * and read-only commands never reach here. self mode is a hard no-op (its
 * `.teamai/` is team knowledge committed to main, not machine data).
